				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users who cannot access non-textual content
					(such as graphics, charts, audio, and video) have access to the information contained in that
					content in textual form.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>How to meet this requirement depends on the complexity of the information expressed. The requirements
					generally break down along the following lines:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>For image content whose information can be conveyed in a sentence or less, authors only need
						to provide alternative text (e.g., in an <code>alt</code> attribute).</li>
					<li>If the image information is more complicated (e.g., for charts and graphs), authors need to
						provide both a brief alternative text and an extended description.</li>
					<li>For audio and video, a label is provided that gives the title or briefly describes the
						purpose (additional audio and video requirements, such as the need for transcripts or captions
						are covered under 1.2).</li>
					<li>For user controls (e.g., buttons and sliders), a text alternative is required that describes
						the function of the control. The text alternative typically is a label.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Note that this success criterion only applies to non-text content that expresses information the
					reader needs to understand. Images that are included purely for aesthetic reasons (e.g., to
					decorate the start of a new section) do not require text alternatives. As visual readers
					gain nothing from these images, there is no need for non-visual readers to be made aware of
					them.</p>
				
				<p>There is also an exception to this success criterion when providing a text alternative would
					invalidate the purpose of the content. For example, if an author includes a test that requires
					audio rendering of the question (e.g., to test spelling).</p>
