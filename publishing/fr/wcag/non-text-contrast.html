				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that there is sufficient contrast in meaningful
					graphics and images, and in user interfaces, so that users with low vision can distinguish and
					understand them.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Meeting this requirement is generally the same as meeting <a href="contrast-minimum.html">1.4.3
					Contrast (Minimum)</a> except that it applies to graphics and user controls instead of text.</p>
				
				<p>When a graphic contains objects that a user needs to discern to understand the content (e.g., the
					slices in a pie chart or bars or lines in a graph), those objects must have a contrast of 3:1 with
					their background. Note that this requirement does not apply when the necessary information is
					available in another form (e.g., if a pie chart lists the purpose and value of each slice, the
					contrast between slices is not relevant).</p>
				
				<p>This requirement also applies to icons used to identify content. Textbooks, for example, often use
					icons to differentiate different types of asides. Similar to graphics, if the icons are
					supplementary to a text label, the requirement does not apply (i.e., the requirement applies only
					when the information is not available in another form).</p>
				
				<p>The requirement also applies to user interface components such as buttons and controls.</p>
