				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can perceive that a control has
					received focus so can be interacted with.</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion is similar to <a href="focus-visible.html">2.4.7</a>, which requires that
					there be a focus indication, but sets requirements for the focus indicator.</p>
				
				<div class="warning" role="note" aria-labelledby="support-note">
					<p id="support-note" class="label">Warning</p>
					
					<p>This success criterion is new in WCAG 2.2 and is subject to change until that specification
						becomes a recommendation.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that any controls have sufficient contrast when they receive focus.
					All the requirements specified in the success criterion text must be met, specifically a 3:1
					contrast for the focus designator both against the control and the area around it, the size
					requirements of the contrast area depending on its shape, and that the control cannot be completely
					obscured by other content.</p>
