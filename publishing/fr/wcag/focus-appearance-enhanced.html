				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can perceive that a control has
					received focus so can be interacted with.</p>
				
				<p>This success criterion is similar to <a href="focus-appearance-minimum.html">2.4.11</a> but sets
					stronger requirements for the focus indicator.</p>
				
				<div class="warning" role="note" aria-labelledby="support-note">
					<p id="support-note" class="label">Warning</p>
					
					<p>This success criterion is new in WCAG 2.2 and is subject to change until that specification
						becomes a recommendation.</p>
				</div>

			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>The primary differences between this success criteria and <a 
					href="focus-appearance-minimum.html">2.4.11</a> is that the contrast ratio must be at least
					4.5:1, the minimum area around the perimeter must be 2px and no content must obscure the
					control.</p>
