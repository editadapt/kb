				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users who cannot hear an audio
					track that accompanies a video clip can still access the information being conveyed.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>To meet this success criterion, the author must caption the video.</p>
				
				<p>The author can use either open or closed captioning to meet this success criterion.</p>
				
				<p>Closed captioning allows users to turn off the captions if they do not wish to view them. The most
					common closed captioning format on the web is WebVTT.</p>
				
				<p>Open captions are part of the video stream (i.e., burned into the video frames) so there is no way
					to disable them.</p>
				
				<p>Note that if the video does not include audio, the requirements of <a
					href="audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded.html">Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)</a>
					apply.</p>
