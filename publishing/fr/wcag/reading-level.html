				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that readers with difficulty processing complex
					text have an alternative in simpler prose.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>To meet this success criterion, publishers must either author their content so that it has a low
					readability score or provide alternative content in simpler prose for all text that uses complex
					language.</p>
				
				<p>Whether this success criterion is attainable will depend on the nature of the publication. It may not
					be realistic, for example, for advanced textbooks and other works that deal with complex topics.</p>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
