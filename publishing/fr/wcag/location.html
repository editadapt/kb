				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can locate their position within a
					publication regardless of how they reached the destination (e.g., if they follow a link from an
					index, it should be possible to determine what chapter they are in or what page they are on).</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Reading systems typically provide enough information to users about their position within a digital
					publication without the need for additional markup.</p>
				
				<p>Authors may choose to embed static page break markers, however, as consistent points of reference
					across reading systems.</p>
				
				<p>Author-provided running headers and footers are generally not supported by reading systems,
					on the other hand, as they generate their own displays. Authors can provide a meaningful title for
					each document as a supplement to the running headers.</p>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The following knowledge base pages provide more information about how to address this success
					criterion for publishing content:</p>
