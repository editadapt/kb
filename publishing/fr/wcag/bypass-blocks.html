				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that readers can easily skip past repetitive
					content at the beginning of a document to locate themselves at the primary text.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>This success criterion is very specific to web sites, which use a common template for each page.
					Without a bypass mechanism, readers who cannot see the layout of the pages would have to navigate
					manually past the site header, any navigation and search areas, etc. to reach the content. This
					process can be time consuming and reduce reading comprehension on the web.</p>
				
				<p>As digital publications are not composed of similar web site trappings, this success criterion
					is almost never likely to apply. The only case might be a publication created by scraping together
					web pages directly off the web.</p>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on bypass blocks due to the lack of
					implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a>
					for additional information.</p>
