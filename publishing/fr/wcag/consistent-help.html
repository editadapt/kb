				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can find a help mechanism in the
					same place on each page when one is available.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>This success criterion is rarely applicable to digital publications because if contact information
					is provided for users to obtain help with a publication, it is not typically repeated across
					documents.</p>
				
				<p>Note that this success criterion does not apply to content-level help mechanisms, such as how to
					fill in forms, use interactive games, etc.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on implementing consistent help mechanisms
					due to the lack of implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG
						guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
