				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users with cognitive disabilities can
					authenticate themselves when cognitive function tests &#8212; such as password input, memorization,
					puzzle solving, and calculations &#8212; are used to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>As it is not common for digital publications to authenticate users, this success criterion rarely
					applies.</p>
				
				<p>If authors do attempt to use authentication forms with cognitive function tests to secure access to
					some part of a publication, they need to ensure at least one method that does not require the test
					or that there is a way to help users with the test.</p>
				
				<p>For example, if a password must be entered, ensuring the user is not prevented from pasting in
					their password would be sufficient.</p>

				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include information on accessible authentication due to the
					lack of implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a href="#guidance">WCAG guidance
						documents</a> for additional information.</p>
