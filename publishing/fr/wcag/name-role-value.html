				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that assistive technologies can identify and
					maintain the state of custom controls.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>If authors create custom controls, they need to ensure that they use the applicable ARIA roles,
					states, and properties to maintain the state of the controls as users interact with them.</p>
				
				<p>Rather than create their own controls, authors are advised to use the various types of controls that
					are defined in HTML. When used as defined, these controls are inherently accessible.</p>
