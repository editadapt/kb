				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users have enough time to interact with the
					content.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Authors need to ensure that users can control time limits that would prevent them from completing a
					task, when the time limit is not essential.</p>
				
				<p>Users should be able to turn off time limits, adjust the time limit to a new preference before
					beginning, or easily extend the time limit when it is about to expire.</p>
				
				<p>In most cases with digital publications, time limits are not essential to the content. They are more
					prevalent on the web, where they are used, for example, to end user sessions for security reasons
					or prevent users from blocking access to products for sale. The rare exception may occur in
					educational works if a test requires specific timing.</p>
