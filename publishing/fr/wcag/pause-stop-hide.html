				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users are not distracted by content
					while reading while trying to read a digital publication.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>Although not as common in digital publications, authors need to ensure that user can stop, pause, or
					hide any content that starts automatically and flashes, blinks, scrolls, or auto-updates.</p>
				
				<p>Examples of such content in digital publications could include a video or animation that is
					automatically initiated when a new document loads or an animated graphic used to identify a type of
					sidebar.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="kb">
				<h3>Additional Information</h3>
				
				<p>The knowledge base does not currently include additional information on pausing distracting content
					due to the general lack of implementation in publishing formats. Refer to the <a 
						href="#guidance">WCAG guidance documents</a> for additional information.</p>
