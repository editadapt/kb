				<h3>Explanation</h3>
				
				<p>Although animated graphics such as animated GIFs are not commonly used in publications, their
					use presents unique challenges for accessibility beyond the <a href="images-desc.html">basics of
						describing</a> them. They are more like very short video clips, so you also need to consider
					some of the same issues that affect videos.</p>
				
				<p>A primary concern is that the image does not present a risk of seizures. Since the images are
					animated, any flashing must not occur more than three times per second. If the animation is less
					than a second, and the animation plays in an endless loop, you must calculate the flashes per
					second by multiplying the number of flashes in the animation by the number of times the animation
					loops in a second.</p>
				
				<p>If the animation ends automatically after five seconds, it meets WCAGs requirement that users be
					able to stop the playback of moving content. Due to the pagination of digital publications, users
					will typically not reach the image before the animation completes. A workaround to this problem is
					to include a control, typically a button, that replaces the animated graphics in a document with
					unanimated equivalents. The user can then decide whether they want the animations to play or
					not.</p>
				
				<div class="note" role="note" aria-labelledby="note-2">
					<p id="note-2" class="label">Note</p>
					<p>Although animations created using the <code>canvas</code> element present the same issues with
						flashing and the need for users to turn off, they also pose additional issues not covered in
						this section. A future update to the knowledge base will cover animated canvases.</p>
