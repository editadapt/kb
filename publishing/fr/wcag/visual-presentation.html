								<li>Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).</li>
								<li>Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).</li>
								<li>Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and
									paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.</li>
								<li>Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that
									does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a
									full-screen window.</li>

				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure that users can reconfigure the text to better
					meet their reading needs, such as enlarging fonts to improve readability for users with low
					vision and changing the text alignment and word spacing to aid users with dyslexia.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="meeting">
				<h3>How to Meet</h3>
				
				<p>As the widely available reading systems provide users the option to control most or all of the text
					properties specified in this success criterion, authors do not need to implement anything extra for
					reflowable EPUB content.</p>
				
				<p>They do need to ensure that when text is resized to 200% that users do not have to scroll to read
					any complete line of text (it is okay if users must scroll to locate the text).</p>
				
				<p>Fixed layout EPUBs cannot meet this success criterion as reading systems do not allow users to
					modify the publisher styles.</p>
